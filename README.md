Song Trainer is a desktop application that helps you practice selected parts of songs by looping a part of a MP4 or MP3 recording along with the changing the tempo of playback.

With the help of the sliders located in the program, you can easily and quickly designate a section of the song to loop. 

If necessary, you can slow down or speed up the playing song.
